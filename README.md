Vs. Construction Crew is a Tobikomi style clone of Vs. Wrecking Crew. Starring Felix Sr. and Felix Jr., constructing a building instead of wrecking one!

## Controls
MAME style controls, can be customized in settings.ini. Each player has four directions, and two action buttons. Esc to quit. Two coin buttons as well.

## Gameplay
Players must build frames and then drywall over those frames in all empty spaces to complete the level. Avoid enemies (hammers, dynamite, and excavators) to stay alive. You can hit some enemies if they're on the other side of the wall. Pickup and deploy ladders where you need them - but be careful, you could get yourself stuck!

## Multiscreen
This game is being designed with two screens, with the Vs. Dual System (Nintendo arcade) cabinets in mind. For two players, it's best to set the settings to 2 screens. The players are on opposite sides of the wall.

## Compile
This game is made with Gamemaker Studio 2. The project needs to be opened and compiled from within. Tested for both Windows and HTML IDE, but I would think it should also work on Mac.
