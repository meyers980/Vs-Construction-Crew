A game starring Felix Sr. and Felix Jr. created in homage to Fix It Felix Jr. and Vs. Wrecking Crew. Designed for play on a Nintendo Vs. Dual System. Imagine a contrustion site, with workers on both sides. That's what this game is all about - Felix Sr and Felix Jr trying to work together (or maybe against!) to construct this building from either side of a wall. Enemies can only hurt you if they're on the same side as you.

You can change controls in settings.ini. To change, find the UTF-8 value for the key you'd like to use (if it's in hex, convert it to decimal). This page shows the decimal values for many keyboard keys. https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/game%20assets/fonts/font_tables.html

[Screens]
For two player, it's recommended to set the screens to 2 in settings.ini. This shows you both sides of the wall.

[Monitors]
If screens are set to two, use this setting to tell the game if you want to play across two monitors, set to 2. If playing on a Vs Unisystem, set to 1. NOTE: This game requires you to manually enter your monitor's horizontal and vertical resolution. If using two monitors, both MUST have the same resolution.

[Primary Monitor]
When playing with two monitors, the game needs to know if your primary monitor is to the right or left of your secondary monitor (Primary Monitor is labeled "1" in Windows display settings). Set to Left or Right.
